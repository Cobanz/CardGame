<h1> How to Play </h1>
 <div> <b>THE DEAL : </b>
                <div>
                    The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.
                </div>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div> <b>THE PLAY :</b>
                <div>
                    Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
                    If the cards are the same rank, it is a draw and the end of the War. The game will end here. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div> <b>HOW TO KEEP SCORE :</b>
                <div>
                    The player with the most cards at the time of a draw or all of the cards in there deck is the winner.
                </div>

<h1>To run the Game Locally </h1>
### `npm install` to get all the packages

when ready to play the game locally you can run the command. 

### `npm start` this will open the app on your browser locally. 

<br/>

This was our first hackathon with Mintbean and we had a lot of fun trying to do something we havnt done before with all the logic that the war game had. Please let us know if you enjoyed it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).****

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
